### Description ###

A webpage/blog-like page with entries concerning coding, software usage and 
development, as well as scientific journalism. This will allow me to consolidate
my relevant academic and work-related interests into one site that will be easy 
to keep track of and share.
 
_note: this is not a blog about my social life. I intend to use it primarily as a sort
 of work log_

### Background ###
I've toyed with the idea for a while of including some sort of blog element to my 
  personal/professional site containing information relevant to my studies and 
  professional pursuits.
