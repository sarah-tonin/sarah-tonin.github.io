### Description ###

A webpage/blog-like page with entries concerning coding, software usage and 
development, as well as scientific journalism. This will allow me to consolidate
my relevant academic and work-related interests into one site that will be easy 
to keep track of and share.
 
_Note: This blog wont be a personal one. I want to use it to primarily for 
work related projects._

### Background ###

I have made blogs before, but they have always been using a social media basis 
like Blogger or Tumblr. With my desire to get into the usage and eventual development 
of software along with open sourse frameworks, it made sense to start up a website 
using GitHub. 

#### Software ####
As a budding biochemist who has a mathematical background, I have an interest in
theoredical models of biological systems. Because the physical structure and composition
of complex cellular activity, having simpler applicable designs as well as robust 
controls over the parameters allows for better understanding of the system of interest.

These models have applications in:
 - immune system and infectious disease modeling
 - protein folding simulations
 - high throughput screening for drug design

Some software that is used for molecular mechanics calculations are: 
- AMBER
- Avagadro
- CHARMM
- PyMOL
- FoldIt or Folding@Home

#### Scientific Journalism ####
Scientific writing is a field of journalism that pertains to reporting science
the public. With technological and engineering feats that have the potential to
change the world essentially on a daily basis, it is important for the general
public to be informed about the goings on in research fields. Moreover, it is 
even more crutial that individuals comprehend and gain a legitimate interest in 
science exploration so to remain engaged and can critically analyze the content. 

Some programs who write to advance science are:
- American Association for the Advancement of Science
- National Association of Science Writers
- The Open Notebook
